# ðŸ§¹ Goal-Based Vacuum Cleaner Agent 

This project simulates a **goal-based agent** (like a robot vacuum) that navigates a 2D grid and cleans dirty cells one by one. It's built using Python and Pygame and is ideal for students learning basic artificial intelligence concepts like agent-environment interaction and pathfinding.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- 9x9 grid of rooms (randomly clean or dirty)
- Agent remembers previously visited cells
- Agent uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the nearest dirty cell
- Simple visual display with colors:
  - ðŸ”´ Red = Dirty
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = Clean
  - ðŸ”µ Blue Border = Agent's position
- Action log and memory shown in the UI
